# VideoToText
A tool to extract text from videos.

## Activate environment

### Windows

Execute the command on the root of the project: 
```
.\venv\Scripts\activate
```

## Execution
This tool must be called by terminal, passing the video absolute filepath as argument. For example:
```
python main.py filepath.mp4
```

## Requirements
Need to install libraries from requirements.txt and also from [Libav](https://libav.org/download/)

To install requirements.txt, you need to run this command:

CAUTION: your machine may have an alias to pip as pip3

[Libav](https://libav.org/download/) needs to be installed directly in the machine.
